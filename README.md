Handwritten diagram datasets in COCO format for the online datasets used in the paper [Arrow R-CNN for handwritten diagram recognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10032-020-00361-1) published by Sch√§fer, Keuper & Stuckenschmidt at IJDAR in 2021.

The [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/bernhardschaefer/handwritten-diagram-datasets/blob/main/demo.ipynb) Jupyter notebook shows how the COCO json files can be parsed and how to visualize the annotated images.

If you use the datasets, also make sure to cite the dataset author papers.
